* Details by Moi

* Mailer uses gmail account info including a app password generated by Gmail. It is used for confirming new user emails, resetting passwords and notifications of messages, likes and visits between users 

* For all location based things I used the gems 'geocoder', 'geokit', and 'area' for location based things 






## Things I wrote but I ended up removing

* One: A filter where the choices were submited by using the Jquery UI library and written js that worked with the ui to show the changes made.


* it is partly due to the need of sorting the results of a search/filter, therefore the parameteres need to be layerable in a sense, or accessable at any given time to be dymanic

I found some great reading on understanding the standards and systems for query_strings here:
