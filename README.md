* Details by Moi

* Mailer uses a Gmail account. This means that to safetly send emails this appilcation includes a app password generated by Gmail in it's private ENV varibles. It is used for confirming new user emails, resetting passwords and notifications of messages, likes and visits between users 

* For all location based things I used the gems 'geocoder', 'geokit', and 'area' for location based things 

* For the search bar I used the pg_search gem

Was removed because of the functionalty of sorting the results of a search/filter, therefore the parameters need to be layerable in a sense, or accessable at any given time to be dymanic. 

The code taken out:

## UI

* I am by not by any means a UI designer but I do have a inexhaustiable curiouty about UI for applications and its design

* I used the gems 'animate.css-rails' and 'jquery-ui-rails' for UI elements along with creating my own layouts
