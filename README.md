* Details by Moi

* Mailer uses a Gmail account. This means that to safetly send emails this appilcation includes a app password generated by Gmail in it's private ENV varibles. It is used for confirming new user emails, resetting passwords and notifications of messages, likes and visits between users 

* For all location based things I used the gems 'geocoder', 'geokit', and 'area' for location based things 

* For the search bar I used the pg_search gem





## Things I wrote but I ended up removing

* One: A filter on the main page for users where the choices were submited by using the Jquery UI library and Javascriot functions that worked with the ui to show the changes made.
Was removed because of the functionalty of sorting the results of a search/filter, therefore the parameters need to be layerable in a sense, or accessable at any given time to be dymanic. 

The code taken out:

Ruby:
```ruby
<%= form_for :filter, :html => { id: "filter"}, url: main_path, method: :get do |thing_form| %>

    <%= thing_form.label "Rating:" %>

    <div id="rating_slider"></div>
    
    <%= thing_form.text_field :low, class: "left_inf" %>
    <%= thing_form.hidden_field :low %>
    <%= thing_form.text_field :high, class: "right_inf"%>
    <%= thing_form.hidden_field :high %>
    <br>

    <%= thing_form.submit "Apply", class: "sub_fil_button" %>
<% end %> 
```
Jquery in slider.js:
```jquery
$(document).ready(function(){
    var slider = $('#rating_slider').slider({

        range: true,
        min: 0,
        max: 10,
        values: [0, 10],
        animate: "slow",
        orientation: "horizontal",

        slide: function(event, ui) {
            $("#filter_low").val(ui.values[0]);
            $("#filter_high").val(ui.values[1]);
        }
    });

        $("#filter_low").val(slider.slider("values")[0]);
        $("#filter_high").val(slider.slider("values")[1]);

});

```



I found some great reading on understanding the standards and systems for query_strings here:

## UI

* I am by not by any means a UI designer but I do have a inexhaustiable curiousty about UI for applications and design

* I used the gems 'animate.css-rails' and 'jquery-ui-rails' for UI elements along with creating my own layouts
