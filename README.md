* Details by Moi

* Mailer uses gmail account info including a app password generated by Gmail. It is used for confirming new user emails, resetting passwords and notifications of messages, likes and visits 

* Using include queries all the info, that statement generates a much larger SQL query loading into memory all the attributes from the other table(s).

* main page and its results are queryed using "?" (join or include??) )if I use include its eager loading but better for the association

* for all location based things I used the gems geocoder and area for location based things 

* Custom form errors
